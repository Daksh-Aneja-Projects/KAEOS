[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-21

The **Workflow, Analytics & Collaboration Platform** release. Turns the seven
department brains from read-only dashboards into an operational system: every
core entity now has a guarded lifecycle, live cross-domain analytics, ownership,
comments, automation, and a unified notification surface — all on real tenant data.

### Added
- **Shared workflow engine** (`app/core/workflow.py`) — declarative per-domain
  state machines with guarded transitions, per-target-state **role floors**,
  business **guard** callables, **SLA thresholds**, a `core_workflow_events`
  audit trail, and a tenant WebSocket broadcast on every transition. Illegal
  moves return 409 with the allowed set; foreign-tenant rows 404 (never confirm ids).
- **Per-domain analytics + workflow endpoints** across Finance, HR, Sales,
  Support, Operations, Legal, Engineering — `GET /{domain}/analytics` (live SQL
  KPIs, charts, insights), `/{domain}/workflows`, `/{domain}/workflow-events`,
  guarded `POST .../{id}/transition`, `POST .../workflows/{type}/bulk-transition`
  (per-id outcomes), and validated entity-**creation** endpoints with auto-numbering.
- **Org Pulse** (`/pulse`) — cross-domain health (insight-severity + SLA-breach
  weighted), unified needs-attention feed, live workflow activity, an **SLA
  Breaches** table, and one-click **Escalate all** (idempotent alerting).
- **Assignment & My Work** (`/my-work`) — assign any entity, per-user "my work",
  team workload, all cross-domain.
- **Comments & @mentions** on any workflow entity, with mention notifications.
- **Automation rules** (`/automation`) — declarative "when an entity dwells in a
  state past N hours, transition / assign / escalate"; rules validated against the
  live workflow registry, evaluated on demand.
- **Notifications & digest** — unified notification feed with unread counts,
  mark-read, and a one-call org digest; SLA/mention/automation alerts surface in
  the header bell alongside the HITL queue.
- **CSV export & saved segments** — export any workflow entity type; save named
  per-domain filters.
- **Live-feel UI** — a `LiveBadge` (WebSocket heartbeat + "synced Ns ago") on the
  main dashboards; domain views and analytics auto-refresh on tenant events.
- Alembic `0004_workflow` and `0005_workspace` (RLS-guarded on Postgres).

### Changed
- **Departments → Marketplace → Deploy** unified into one funnel: Departments
  shows what you run, the Marketplace is the catalog, and "Deploy This Pack"
  carries the chosen pack into the wizard (skipping its duplicate pack-picker).
  Standalone "Deploy" removed from the top nav.
- **ROI cost-saved** now derives transparently from live hours-saved × a
  documented loaded hourly rate (`LOADED_HOURLY_RATE_USD`, default $85) instead of
  reading an unpopulated metrics table — fixes the `$0` cost card while hours were
  non-zero. Rate is shown as a footnote for honesty.

### Fixed
- SLA-escalation dedupe now matches the `action_taken` column's `False` default
  (not just NULL), so re-running escalation never re-alerts open breaches.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-20

First public release.

### Added
- **Company Brain** — unified rules/skills/signals layer with a cross-domain
  knowledge graph and 5-dimensional confidence scoring.
- **Seven Department Brains** — HR, Finance, Legal, Sales, Support, Operations,
  and Engineering & IT Ops, each with domain agents running the gated pipeline.
- **Agent Factory** — create → approve → compile → deploy → orchestrate agents
  from a plain-English prompt.
- **Governance spine** — compliance / fairness / confidence-HITL / adversarial-debate
  gates, a hash-chained (tamper-evident) provenance ledger, and red-team checks. Gates **fail closed**.
- **AI Foundry (Phase 2)** — curates execution history into a tenant-scoped,
  RLS-isolated training dataset. (Model fine-tuning is a later phase and is
  labelled as such in-product — no models are trained today.)
- **Real-data benchmarks** — decision logic scored against seven public enterprise
  datasets; wins **and** losses reported transparently (`backend/benchmark`).
- **BYOK LLM routing** — LiteLLM gateway across Anthropic/OpenAI/Groq/Ollama with
  retry, circuit-breaker, budget gate, and per-call cost metering.

### Security
- Per-tenant **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security** on every tenant table, verified
  effective at startup (`assert_rls_effective`) and provable via `scripts/verify_rls.py`.
- No default/public login — the root admin is provisioned from `ADMIN_EMAIL` /
  `ADMIN_PASSWORD`; nothing ships with known credentials.
- **JWT sessions via PyJWT** (migrated off `python-jose` to close the algorithm-
  confusion CVE) with per-token `jti`, a revocation denylist, and a `/auth/logout`
  that revokes the caller's token. Login has brute-force lockout after repeated
  failures and a minimum password length on user creation.
- **Role-based access control** (`viewer`/`operator`/`admin`) enforced via
  `require_role` on consequential/mutating endpoints (create, update, delete,
  execute, HITL approve, connector credentials, deployment, pack install); cross-
  tenant platform actions gated on an admin secret. HITL approvals are role-gated
  and recorded against the authenticated principal, not free text.
- **High-consequence actions always route to a human.** Payments, terminations,
  contract execution, external sends, and data deletion force the HITL gate
  regardless of model confidence; the confidence threshold itself is configurable
  (`CONFIDENCE_AUTONOMOUS_EXEC`) rather than hardcoded.
- **Security audit trail** (`SecurityAuditLog`) wired to real runtime events —
  auth successes/failures, RBAC denials, HITL decisions, config/connector/export
  actions — as a best-effort writer that never blocks a request.
- **Data protection** — right-to-erasure (`privacy_erasure`), a `DATA_RESIDENCY`
  local-LLM-only mode that refuses cloud providers and strips cloud credentials,
  optional PII scrubbing before cloud egress, and PII redaction in logs.
- `/metrics` is **off by default** (opt-in via `EXPOSE_METRICS`); interactive API
  docs fail closed outside a development environment. The `python_sandbox` agent
  tool is off by default (prompt-injection RCE surface).
- BYOK connector credentials encrypted at rest (PBKDF2-derived key); hardened
  agent code sandbox; fail-fast production config validation (refuses to boot on
  insecure config or SQLite-in-production).

### Verified
- Full end-to-end suite (**426 tests**, 29 files) green on SQLite **and** on
  PostgreSQL + pgvector against a live server with a local LLM.
- Black-box attack re-checks against the running container: malformed login
  returns 422 (not 500), `/metrics` is hidden, liveness probe works, brute-force
  lockout engages, and unauthenticated HITL approval is rejected.
- Tenant isolation verified on real PostgreSQL: cross-tenant reads scoped,
  cross-tenant writes blocked, missing-context fails closed.
- Independent adversarial code review of the security remediation: no
  Critical/High regressions found.

### Known limitations / roadmap
- AI Foundry model **fine-tuning** (Phases 3–5) is not implemented yet.
- Some "frontier" simulation surfaces (enterprise-physics what-if, evolution
  fitness) are parameterized simulations, labelled as such — not learned models.
- Rate limiting is per-process (in-memory); use a shared limiter behind a
  multi-instance deployment.
- Pre-production checklist (load testing, a formal pen-test, and a one-time
  connector-credential re-encryption if upgrading) is in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
